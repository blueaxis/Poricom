## About <a name = "about"></a>
Poricom is a desktop program for optical character recognition in manga images. Although it is a manga OCR application, it can recognize text on other type of images as well. The project is a GUI implementation of the [Manga OCR library](https://pypi.org/project/manga-ocr/0.1.5/) (supports Japanese only) and the Tesseract-API python wrapper [tesserocr](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr) (supports other languages). See demo below to see how it works.

Detect text on locally stored manga images:

Perform OCR on the current screen by pressing `Alt+Q`:

## User Guide  <a name="user_guide"></a>
Follow the installation instructions [here](#installation). Load a directory with manga images and select text boxes with Japanese text. If you are not getting good results using the default settings, [use the MangaOcr model](#load_model) to improve text detection.

## Installation <a name = "installation"></a>
Download the latest zip file [here](https://github.com/bluaxees/Poricom/releases/latest/). Decompress the file in the desired directory. Make sure that the `app` folder is in the same folder as the shortcut `Poricom`.

For developers, clone this repo and install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Run the app in the command line using `python main.py`. 

### System Requirements

Recommended:
- Hard drive: at least 800 MB HD space
- RAM: at least 2 GB

Approximately 250 MB of free space and 200 MB of memory is needed to run the application using the Tesseract API. If using the Manga OCR model, an additional 450 MB of free space and 800 MB of memory is required.

For developers, the following Python versions are supported: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
